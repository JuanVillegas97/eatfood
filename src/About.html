                EATDFOOD, was founded by a team of 4 during a school project in
                2022. It started as personal webpage with the finality to prove
                our skills in the front and back end. The main idea was born due
                the pandemic, at the time many restaurants have chosen to have a
                business model focused on e-commerce and using delivery services
                such as Uber Eats and Rappi. That is why our team decided that
                creating this web page ordering food at home is done almost
                entirely through apps or websites that allow you to do that,
                they are very easy and practical, in them you can have a catalog
                of all the restaurants available and there is no need to call or
                look for the menu of each place. Thanks to this, food ordering
                websites have become very popular. We saw an area of opportunity
                to be able to compete in a new market with a lot of demand.
